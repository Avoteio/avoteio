# Avoteio 

Avoteio is a cloud-supported, mobile-ready, React-powered, Spotify-based song voting app. Users can use spotify-premium accounts to create and host rooms. Rooms are accessible through the url generated by the creation of a room. Upon entering a room, users can add, upvote, and downvote existing songs; the songs will be played through the host's spotify account. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Avoteio requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
```sh
$ cd avoteio
$ npm install
```
Start the server in its own terminal
 ``` $npm run server-dev```
 
 In a separate terminal run the client
 ``` $npm run react-dev ```


### Tech

Avoteio uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Facebook's front-end framework
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) -Declarative routing for React
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/oauth/) - Handling for Spotify authorization (OAuth)
* Socket.Io - Use of sockets to handle real-time voting and song addition using sockets.
